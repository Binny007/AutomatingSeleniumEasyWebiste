# AutomatingSeleniumEasyWebiste


--> The reason Testing/Automation is such an important part of Software Development is that you can do things really, really fast. You let the machine control the browser, extremely fast. So you can test as many times as you want, may be millions of times.

--> In this project, I will be using one of the best tools for browser automation called 'Selenium'. So using 'Selenium', I want to actually mimic the 'SeleniumEasy' website
(URL: https://demo.seleniumeasy.com/basic-first-form-demo.html) that we would do on a browser. Lets say i want to modiy this website, where I enter some text in my code editor, and show message in the website not by signing the website and not manually typing it.

--> So in this project I have used 'ChromeDriver' to automate Google Chrome. And the 'SeleniumEasy' website allows us to give a nice testing ground for us to play with, that is input forms, typing a message and dispaying that message manually. Instead, I want to automate this steps and let 'Selenium' do that for us.

--> This is a simple example. But did you notice how fast everything happened ? If a human was to do this, you'd have to select the Enter message field, and type the message and then you have to click on Show Message. And then your message finally gets displayed.

--> You can simulate clicks, you can enter information. Just any thing that a human can do, Selenium lets you do that for you.
